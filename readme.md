# Carnation

Merriam-Webster defines carnation as:

We define carnation as the best tool for managing the Visual Studio editor's syntax highlighting colors.

### Classification Grid

The classification grid will list all configurable classifications for the editor. From the grid you are able to click on the Foreground and Background colors to customize to your liking.

### Searching Classifications

Since the list of classifications can be large and hard to navigate, we have included a searchbox which will allow you to quickly navigate to the classifications you want to customize.

### Following the Cursor

If you do not know the name for a classification you want to update, don't worry. We have a "Follow Cursor" option which will show you the classification at your cursor as well as all the classifications within your editor's selection.

## Accessibility Features

### Contrast

Carnation wants to help you make your code easy to read by making the contrast ratio of your color choices visible at all times. In the Classification Grid you will see the contrast ratio as well as whether the contrast meets WCAG 2.0 requirements.
